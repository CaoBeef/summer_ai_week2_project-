Overall, the Pacman Project went really well for me. I was able to make the depth-first search and breadth-first search parts of 
the project work. It felt easy because our class explained everything in detail, so I knew what to do. The pre-written Python code 
with things like Stack and Queue was also easy to read.

But, I did face a problem when I made my logic. Even though the path was shown, Pacman wouldn't move, which was frustrating. I didn't 
know what was causing the problem. To fix it, I had to check some other files to see how Pacman was supposed to move. After a while, 
I figured out that I needed to return a set of directions. It worked, but it took a long time to implement because of some specific Python syntax.
